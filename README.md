# Miscellaneous Projects Repo

This repository showcases my work projects and personal study post-grad. Current projects stored here include:

1. impact.ipynb - An archived analytics framework used to analyze routing changes (2022-2023) 
2. row-counter.html - Simple mobile app that helps me keep track of fiber arts projects. Made because most apps I used are now paywalled.
